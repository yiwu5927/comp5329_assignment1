## Overview
This project notebook focuses on the data pre-processing phase of a machine learning pipeline.  
It includes dataset loading, standardization, one-hot encoding, and visualization of label distributions.  
It prepares the data for further training, validation, and testing.

## Structure
1. Import Necessary Libraries
2. Data pre-processing
3. MPL
4. Explore Data 
5. Data Visualization 

## Code and Markdown Summary
- Code cells: 19  
- Markdown cells: 7

## Requirements
This notebook uses the following Python libraries:
- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- os

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.  
2. Place your dataset files (`train_data.npy`, `train_label.npy`, `test_data.npy`, `test_label.npy`) are  in the correct directory or correctly referenced.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom to perform data preprocessing and generate visualizations.  
4. The notebook includes:
   - Loading and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
   - Standardizing the feature data
   - Converting labels into one-hot encoded format
   - Plotting the label distribution using `matplotlib`

## Note
This README documents the preprocessing pipeline implemented in the notebook.  
Follow the instructions to reproduce the workflow and prepare data for downstream machine learning tasks.
